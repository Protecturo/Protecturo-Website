        <a href="/">back</a><h1>Terms of</h1>

<p>These terms of service (“TOS”) are entered into between Protecturo Ltd. hereafter referred to as (“” “Protecturo”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) and you (“Customer”, “you”, or “your”). You agree to be bound by these TOS when you, or your agent, click “I agree.” The date you agree to these TOS is the “Effective Date”. The entity set out in our records is considered by us to be our customer.</p>

<p>These TOS apply automatically to all Protecturo clients upon subscription to the Services including subscription through a third party or any commercial partner. BY SUBSCRIBING TO Protecturo’S SERVICES YOU ACCEPT THE POLICIES LISTED HEREIN AND AGREE TO RESPECT THEM. The Services are described as the package description presented on our web site and ordered by you.</p>

<p>If you are reselling the Service, or are an End User of a reseller, it is your obligation to ensure that our records accurately reflect ownership and control of the Service. If you are a reseller of our Services, these TOS contain provisions that you are required to apply to your customers (“End Users”). It is your responsibility to ensure that these provisions, or others no less protective of our interests, are included in the contracts and other agreements between you and your End Users. You are responsible for your End Users under these TOS. If you intend to resell the Services, you must also sign our Re-seller Agreement.</p>

<p>These TOS may be amended by us. Except in an emergency, we agree to provide you with thirty days notice prior to the effective date of any amendment. Notice will be provided to you though your control panel. If the amendment materially affects your ability to use the Services, you may terminate your use of the Services and these TOS by providing us with written notice prior to the Effective Date of the amended TOS, or, if we have amended the TOS without prior notice because of an emergency, within thirty days from the date of our amendment.
Article 1 – Other Agreements Are Incorporated into these TOS</p>

<p>The present TOS incorporate our Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and our Privacy Policy for website, portal and social media and our Privacy Policy for Hermes OS which governs the privacy information for our product suite.</p>

<p>To the extent that above-mentioned policies conflict with the TOS or with each other, the TOS shall prevail, followed by the AUP and both of our Privacy Policies. In certain cases, you may purchase services from us using another agreement which is also incorporated into or references these TOS. If that agreement conflicts with these TOS, the terms of that other agreement will prevail over the TOS, but only to the extent of the conflict.
Article 2 – Object</p>

<p>We agree to provide the Services to you subject to these TOS. Use of the Services constitutes acceptance and agreement to these TOS.
Article 3 – Services</p>

<p>The features and details of the services governed by these TOS are described on our web site “.io” as of the Effective Date. Should any of the product description change subsequent to the Effective Date, Protecturo has no obligation to modify the Services to reflect such a change. The specific services chosen by you are referred to together as the “Services” or the “Service”. You agree to use the Services in a way that respects the right of our other users to use the Services, and not to act in a way that unreasonably interferes with our ability to provide the Services to other users.</p>

<p>Certain aspects of the Services may be provided by third parties. In fact, the Services are rely on PGP, an open source technology. These third parties may have reserved the right to make changes, including material changes, to the products provided by them and incorporated into the Service. If a third party makes a change to its products, you agree that you may not terminate the Services and these TOS based on such a change, even if it materially affects the Services.
Article 4 – Support
What we Support</p>
<ol>
  <li>Common Services</li>
</ol>

<p>We continually monitor and ensure that all basic services are working, such as XMPP chat servers, email host severs, PHP, Web services, Hermes Management Portal and our Admin/sales panel. Our number one priority is to make sure that the web servers, data centers, and network connections are functioning at optimal performance levels.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Basic E-mail and Client Configuration</li>
</ol>

<p>We provide instructions for using the most common e-mail clients. If you need additional help, do not hesitate to open a support ticket or call us. We will do our best to assist you with making a connection to your account.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Server Software</li>
</ol>

<p>We will maintain and secure all software that resides on a server, such as Charon Secure Messenger , PKI, Hermes Management Portal, Exchange, billing portal, etc.. We will determine the version and configuration of the software on our servers. As a result, the software we have installed may not always be the latest version available to the public or be compatible with your application.
What we do Not Support</p>
<ol>
  <li>Data Backup</li>
</ol>

<p>You are responsible for maintaining current backups of your data. We maintain our own backups in the event of a disaster; however, we do not store any data beyond contact lists and. Chat messages not yet delivered may be available on our servers for a limited amount of time, but once downloaded to your device, are irretrievable by us. Email messages can potentially be retrieved, but only if unencrypted. We perform regular maintenance, and backups of servers and server settings are included in this, however, when a lost PGP key can render your entire mailbox illegible and irretrievable (by us). We can therefore make no promises with regards to backups, nor guarantee your content in any way.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Email Restore</li>
</ol>

<p>We do not offer recovery of lost or deleted emails. We recommend you first check your deleted items folder if you accidentally delete an email. If you have your deleted items folder set to auto-clean or you delete the messages from your deleted items folder, these messages will not be retrievable by us. In addition, as stated above, because a lost PGP key can render a mailbox illegible, we can only offer best effort support.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Third Party Applications</li>
</ol>

<p>Whether server-side or client-side, we do not support applications other than those that are distributed with our Hermes OS bundle or Hermes Communication Device offerings.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Hardware Not Provided or Maintained by us</li>
</ol>

<p>Some customers like our support so much, they ask us to help them with things completely unrelated to their application or services (e.g. configuring a printer on their network). We wish this were feasible!
Article 5 – Term</p>

<p>These TOS will continue for the term set out on the product description page (“Initial Term”). After the expiration of the Initial Term, these TOS will renew for successive periods of equal length (“Renewal Term”). If the product description page does not contain an Initial Term, the Initial Term shall be one month.
Article 6 – Payment</p>

<p>You are responsible for the fees and charges set out on the product description page (“Fees”). You may be charged seven days prior to the date set out on the product description page (“Due Date”).</p>

<p>Our obligation to provide the Services is contingent on your payment of the Fees by the Due Date. It is your responsibility to ensure that we receive payment of the Fees. You must pay the Fees without set off or deduction. Should the Services be suspended, for any reason, Fees will continue to accrue. If the Fees are not paid by your financial institution on the Due Date, your account will be considered delinquent. To reinstate your account, you will be required to pay, depending on the reason for the delinquency: (i) a returned check fee in the amount of 100$ ; (ii) interest in the amount of 15 % per year; (iii) collection charges; (iv) any fees levied on us by our financial institution; and/or (v) an investigation fee of $100.</p>

<p>You may choose to purchase products and services that are not included in the Service but which are offered for sale by other parties through Protecturo (“Third Party Services”). Third Party Services may be billed separately from the Service. Fees for the Third Party Services may not be billed on the month on which they are delivered. You agree to pay for these Third Party Services regardless of the length of time elapsed between their delivery date and the date on which you are charged.
Article 7 – Bill Disputes</p>

<p>If you believe there is an error on your bill you must contact us in writing. We each agree to work together in good faith to resolve any billing disputes. Your dispute must include sufficient facts for us to investigate your claims and be received by us at least five days prior to the Due Date (“Dispute Deadline”). You waive your right to dispute any charges or Fees if you fail to meet Dispute Deadline. If we find that your claim is valid, we agree to credit the account that is the subject of the dispute the next time Fees are due. If you contact your credit card company, prior to notifying us of the dispute, and initiate a “charge back” based on this dispute, and your charge back claim is past the Dispute Deadline, you will be charged a $200 investigation fee. This fee compensates us for the investigation your credit card issuer requires us to conduct in order to demonstrate our right to payment.
Article 8 – Termination
Money Back Guarantee</p>

<p>Provided that you did not pay for the Services by bit coin, we offer an unconditional seven day satisfaction guarantee (Guarantee). To cancel the Service covered by the Guarantee, and receive a refund, you must contact us within seven calendar days following the Effective Date for the Service covered by the Guarantee. If you wish to retain your domain name, the cost of your domain name will be deducted from your refund at our regular, non-discounted, price. As mentioned if you paid by bit coin, we will not issue any refunds. If you paid us by credit card we will credit the card on file, otherwise we will send you a check. The Guarantee only applies to an individual Service for seven calendar days following the Effective Date. If you purchase more than one Service from us, the Guarantee only applies to the Service that falls within this seven day period. Set up and domain name registration charges are not refundable for any reason and are excluded from our Guarantee.
Termination Prior to Renewal</p>

<p>Either party may choose not to renew these TOS by providing written notice to the other no later than ten days before the expiration of the Initial Term or Renewal Term for the particular Service that the party does not want to renew. If you terminate these TOS prior to their expiration, you will not receive a refund of any prepaid Fees.
Termination for Material Breach</p>

<p>One party may terminate these TOS upon the occurrence of a material breach, if this breach has not been cured by the other party within thirty days of their receipt of written notice of the breach. Notices of material breach must contain sufficient detail for the party against whom the assertion of material breach is directed to identify the breach and attempt to take corrective action. A decision to cease offering Third Party Services will not be a material breach.
Termination for your Violation of our Policies</p>

<p>We reserve the right to immediately suspend the Service and/or terminate this TOS: (i) for a violation of any of our policies, including those incorporated by reference or those of Third Party Service providers; and/or (ii) your failure to pay any amounts due. This right of termination is without prejudice to any other rights we may have. Should we exercise these rights, You are not entitled to any type of notice or protest and nor will you receive a refund of any Fees.
Disposition of Data Upon Suspension or Termination</p>

<p>When your account is suspended or terminated, the data and other technology resident on Protecturo’s servers may be deleted. It is your obligation, regardless of whether you believe a suspension or termination is authorized under this TOS, to secure this data and ensure that it remains available to you. Protecturo has no obligation to preserve data after a suspension or termination, other than those provided under law.

You agree that we may place restrictions on your use of the Service, and charge you excess bandwidth fees, to the extent that your use exceeds the use of the Service by similarly situated customers. You understand that bandwidth, connection speeds and other similar indices of capacity are maximum numbers. Consistently reaching these capacity numbers may result in our need to place restrictions on your use of the Service.</p>

<p>You agree to cooperate with us to facilitate your use of the Service. This cooperation includes, but is not limited to, providing us with correct contact and billing information, designing material that is “server ready” and ensuring that you, your employees and/or agents have sufficient technical expertise to understand how to implement the Service.</p>

  <li>Email services</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyone found to be generating spam from within our system will have their user privileges revoked immediately. Persons attempting to forward spam email messages inbound to our system will be blocked and prevented from sending further email to any Charon Email users. Please note, however, that many messages appearing to originate from Charon Email (or any other) mail servers could contain “forged headers”, written by the party originating the messages to make them appear to come from somebody else. This is done to avoid action normally taken against those abusing email systems and to cause damage to the reputation of the parties appearing to have sent the messages. Experienced investigators can tell immediately whether headers have been forged and where the message actually originated; thus, it is important that any mail forwarded to us for investigation contains the complete headers from the original message.</p>

<p>We define spam or unsolicited commercial e-mail as e-mail that has not been requested by the recipient, is not compliant with the Canadian Anti-Spam Act, or that, even if requested, or compliant with the Canadian Anti-Spam Act, causes other entities to block our IP Addresses.</p>

<p>You may not use the Service to host a site that is advertised in SPAM (a spamvertized site), even if you yourself are not engaged in spamming. If we determine that you or an End User are spamming, we will suspend or terminate your account, at our discretion.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While we do not undertake to monitor the materials that are sent through our email service, we reserve the right to review such materials, and to remove any materials at our sole discretion. We may decide, at our sole discretion, to terminate your access to our email service at any time, without notice. We cannot, however, promise any legal agency the ability to review data on our servers, as we ourselves cannot retrieve anything encrypted on, or deleted from, our servers.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Notices</li>
</ol>

<p>If you believe that our AUP has been violated, you may send your inquiry to: info@.io. Please note that we do not review anonymous inquiries. Your notice must contain, at a minimum, your first and last name, and either a working, monitored e-mail address, or a working, monitored, telephone number.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Co-operation with Investigations and Legal Proceedings</li>
</ol>

<p>We do not review or monitor our customers’ activities. However, if we are legally required to permit any relevant authority to inspect your content or traffic, you agree we can do so; provided however that, where possible without breaching any legal or regulatory requirement, we may choose to give you reasonable prior notice of such requirement. As stated, we cannot and will not be held responsible for housing criminal or suspected criminal activity, or abuse of our acceptable use policy, whether by omission, or by failing to investigate claims. If activity in breach of our terms is discovered or made known to us, we may, without notice to you, report to the appropriate authorities any conduct by you that we believe violates applicable law, and provide any information we have about you, or your users or your traffic and cooperate in response to a formal request from a law enforcement or regulatory agency investigating any such activity, or in response to a formal request in a civil action that on its face meets the requirements for such a request. Law enforcement agencies that seek information about customers, End Users, and third parties and/or their use of the Service, are required to submit a subpoena, or other similar document, pursuant to which we are required by law to produce this information (Subpoena). Unless specifically required by law and so clearly communicated to us, the Subpoena will be transmitted to the customers, End Users, and third parties and/or their use of the Services are required to submit a subpoena, or other similar document, pursuant to which we are required by law to produce this information (“Subpoena”). Unless specifically prohibited by law and clearly communicated to us, the Subpoena will be transmitted to the customer, End User, or third party. Civil requests for information, such as discovery requests and similar demands (“Civil Demands”) must be part of a filed and pending litigation matter. Responses to Civil Demands are at our discretion.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Excessive Use of Shared System Resources</li>
</ol>

<p>Our email service is considered unlimited, meaning that within reason there are no limits on storage space, number of emails sent or received per day, or number of device connections. However, since you will be sharing bandwidth and storage with hundreds of others on our servers in a virtual community, our offerings are really not intended to support enterprise level or large company requirements. To ensure that our hosting is first-class, reliable, and available to all customers within that server community, an individual customer’s usage cannot adversely affect the performance of other customers’ service. This means that while there is no set limit on storage, bandwidth usage, or emails in or out-bound, we will need to monitor for possible misuse.</p>

<p>An example of misuse would be using auto-mailing for spam purposes. If you are generating a consistent outbound flow of several thousand emails, and your inbox is filling by a gigabyte a day, we can safely assume that you are using shared resources frivolously. Other potential violations could include using our email service to store an excessive amount/type of materials, to the point it adversely affects other users rights to service. An example could be sending yourself an excessive amount of large attachments such as mp3’s, images or short video files. We do not monitor content, but general behavior and types of files stored can become a red flag. Flooding other users’ email inboxes could be a potential breach as well, as it can be construed as a DoS (Denial of Service) attack.</p>

<p>In the vast majority of cases, if you use the email hosting service appropriately, you will be able to view, send, receive, upload, download, and attach as much content as you wish. However, in certain circumstances our server processing power, server memory, or anti-abuse controls could place limits on your usage. Those who abuse the Services will not be tolerated and you agree that your right to use the Services is subject to the rules outlined above.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Suspension and/or Termination of products and Credits.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you violate our AUP and we suspend or terminate the Service, you will not receive a refund of any Fees paid to us. Your failure to abide by any of the items set out in this AUP is grounds for suspension or termination of the Service. Any termination or suspension may be undertaken with, or without, notice to you. You agree to hold us harmless from any claims that a suspension or termination of products for this reason has damaged you or any claims from a third party that the suspension or termination has damaged them.
SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT</p>

<p>This Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) describes the level and availability of the Services. The SLA is incorporated by reference into the TOS between you and Protecturo. Capitalized terms used in this SLA that are not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the TOS in effect between you and Protecturo.</p>

<p>Choosing a communication product suite is never easy since your privacy and data is at stake. We know that the availability of the Services and access to your data is of the utmost importance to you and it is something that we take very seriously. This is why we have built SLA to cover the multiple components that keep the Services up and running.</p>

<p>By signing up for Services on the Internet, or by using any other means of subscription including subscription via a third party, a sales representative or commercialization partner, you benefit from the present network and power up-time guarantee if you are billed directly by Protecturo.</p>

<p>We want you to feel at ease with your decision to purchase Services from us, and to know that we take your communication and data as seriously as you do.
Article 1 – General Terms and Conditions for all Services</p>
<ol>
  <li>Account Administration</li>
</ol>

<p>Protecturo provides your designated administrators with access to a dedicated account management tool. Via this tool, you or your designated administrators will be able to change passwords, enable new user accounts and disable old user accounts and other similar management functions.
You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your administrators’ passwords and accounts. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify Protecturo immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. Protecturo will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge.

<ol>
  <li>Systems Support</li>
</ol>

<p>We provide systems support to your designated administrators. Systems support is defined as support associated with issues/faults with our servers. There are no additional charges for this support (we ask that you please check the Server Status Page on our website before calling our systems support). You may designate up to four, but no more than four, administrators who are authorized to call Protecturo’s client support services.</p>
<ol>
  <li>End-Users and Custom Support Services</li>
</ol>

<p>No support to your end-users shall be provided by Protecturo unless specifically agreed to in writing by us. Directing your end-users or any third parties that are not administrators to our technical support service will constitute a breach of this SLA. We do offer affiliate agreements for our Services. Additionally, several support services may be provided on an as-needed basis, with separate pricing for each support service or on a per-project basis. Please contact us for details.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Migration Services</li>
</ol>

<p>At your request, Protecturo will provide an advance estimate of fees for migration from one system or provider to our Services, based on the information you provide. However, you acknowledge that our Fees will be calculated on the basis of the actual amount of data migrated and may exceed the estimate. You acknowledge that after we begin the migration services it is possible that we will discover technical limitations related to the configuration of your data that prevent us from successfully completing the migration. You acknowledge that there is a risk that data will be lost during a migration and you undertake to create a reliable backup of all data to be migrated prior to the time that Protecturo begins the migration. You agree that Protecturo will not be liable to you or to any third party for damages resulting from the loss or corruption of your information or third party information as part of the migration.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Server Software</li>
</ol>

<p>We exercise industry standard practices to ensure that software is correctly configured in all material respects. If there is more than one way to configure software, we will choose the configuration that we determine, in our sole discretion, to be the most appropriate. We reserve our rights to install security patches, updates, and service packs, at our sole discretion and only to the extent that such security patches, updates and service packs exist and are beneficial and compatible with our Services. Software updates may change system behavior and functionality and as such may negatively affect your applications. We cannot foresee nor can we be held responsible for service disruption or changes in functionality or performance due to implementation of software patches and upgrades or other scheduled maintenance. If such disruption or changes occur, we will provide our best efforts to remedy the situation as soon as possible after being notified of the problem by you.</p>

<p>We are not responsible for problems that may arise from incompatibilities between new versions of software and your content, regardless of whether it was a requested, required or discretionary upgrade.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Security</li>
</ol>

<p>Access to our data center and systems is restricted to authorized personnel. We ensure that our employees and contractors are familiar with and understand our policies. We will make our best commercial efforts to protect the security of our systems and services, and the data that resides therein.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Data Retention</li>
</ol>

<p>Protecturo shall not be held responsible for retaining any of your data after account termination, unless as expressly provided hereunder. All data is deleted from the servers after the account is terminated and from back-ups during scheduled back-up rotation or earlier, at our convenience. We shall not restore, provide on any storage media, or otherwise transmit any data pertaining to existing or terminated accounts. Except in the case of termination due to abuse, a window of time for migration, removal, or other handling of data will be provided.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Incident Reports, Credits and Refunds</li>
</ol>

<p>If an incident causes one or several of the Services selected by you to be unavailable temporarily, you may be credited and/or refunded in accordance with the “Service Unavailability Credits” section applicable for each Service.
Protecturo SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER FOR SERVICE UNAVAILABILITY OTHER THAN WHAT IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THE APPLICABLE “SERVICE UNAVAILABILITY CREDITS” SECTIONS HEREIN.
To request a credit and/or a refund for any loss of Service, the client must file a report (an “Incident Report”) within fifteen (15) days of the occurrence of the loss of Service event to info@.io. This “Incident Report” must contain a detailed description of the Services affected, problems observed and the duration of the event. Before processing any credit request, our accounting team will validate the information you provided in the Incident Report to confirm the loss of Service availability, its timeframe and corresponding credit and/or refund. Credit, if any, will be applied to the next invoice for the affected Service.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Maximum Aggregate Credits and Refunds</li>
</ol>

<p>In any case where credits and/or refunds are granted to a client for a loss of Service, the maximum aggregate cumulative amount of such credits and/or refunds, in any given month for any given Service shall not exceed to total amount of Fees otherwise payable by you for this Service during this month.
You are not entitled to a credit and/or refund if you are in breach of the TOS, the AUP (and any of the documents incorporated therein by reference), including breach of payment obligations, at the time of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the credit until you have cured the breach. You are not entitled to a credit and/or refund if the event giving rise to the credit and/or refund would not have occurred but for your breach of the TOS or AUP (and any of the documents incorporated therein by reference) or your fault or negligence.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Previous Versions of This SLA</li>
</ol>

<p>This version of the SLA supersedes any and all previous versions of the applicable SLA distributed or made available by Protecturo, its representatives or agents. The procedure to change this SLA is governed by our TOS.
Article 2 – Specific Terms and Conditions for Charon Secure Messenger</p>
<ol>
  <li>Service Description</li>
</ol>

<p>provides Hermes OS as a secure communication application. Calls made are peer to peer, and not reliant on storage. For that reason, only the server configurations and applicable services are backed up for this application. Charon Secure Messenger is largely the same, except that it relies on XMPP server configurations for base functionality. Messages can be stored, but only in a self-destructing node, until they can be delivered to the recipient. Once downloaded by the recipient’s device, they are no longer available on our servers.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Disaster Recovery</li>
</ol>

<p>We schedule nightly backups to the shared backup devices. Backups are monitored and checked for errors, and regularly scheduled tests of the restoration procedures are performed. Backup copy retention time is fifteen days. We do not warrant, however, that a valid backup is available for every day of this fifteen day period, as applicable. If a disruption of the Service occurs, We will assign our highest priority and will make our best commercial efforts to ensure the timely restoration of the Service. Depending on the type of disruption that has occurred, we might elect to first restore the Service without the data. Any data not immediately accessible after a disruption in the Service will be restored from the most recent backup and made accessible with Protecturo’s highest priority.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Restoration</li>
</ol>

<p>Protecturo cannot restore any Charon Mail or Charon Secure Messenger messages sent via our Service, as messages are only stored until sent to the recipient device. Upon download by the recipient device, they are irretrievable by any means from our servers.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Maintenance</p>

    <p>Planned Maintenance:
 Planned maintenance is typically scheduled between 1am and 3am EST, and typically performed over the weekend. Two-day prior notice shall be given by Protecturo.
 Hot Fixes:
 Installation of urgent “hot fixes” is scheduled as quickly as possible after testing, and a notification is sent to you. The two-day notification mentioned above is waived for urgent hotfixes. Protecturo also reserves additional two (2) two-hour maintenance windows on Wednesdays and Saturdays from 11:00 PM to 1:00 AM (EST), during which the servers may be offline for urgent fixes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Servers availability</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Subject to the exclusions described below, Protecturo undertakes to maintain 99.9% server uptime, defined as the ability to connect to the Email, Chat, or Voice servers, calculated on a monthly basis. Protecturo will not monitor availability of individual users or accounts but only monitors the server availability as a whole.</p>

<p>Protecturo calculates uptime as a percentage of the time in a month (30 days X 24 hours X 60 minutes) during which the system is available, excluding, but not limited to, the conditions above and all scheduled and urgent maintenances.</p>

<p>Any loss of Service availability lasting less than five minutes will not be included in the calculation of Service availability. Protecturo calculates Service Availability based on both monitoring system and incident report from engineering team.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Exclusions</li>
</ol>

<p>Any circumstance beyond Protecturo’s reasonable control, including but not limited to the following conditions, will not be included in email, XMPP and web server availability calculations:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Problem located on the customer’s side, including network/Internet issue, problem with 3rd party application; loss of Service availability due to Network Attacks such as denials of Service;
SYN or similar attacks, issue caused by DNS resolution and/or domain name or certificate expiration;
Mail bombing or other flooding attacks;
Software “bugs” or problems within used products creating service interruptions, hardware bug or failure beyond high-availability system;
Problem located outside our control within the Datacenter exploited by Protecturo, such as Internet and power availability or any other situation mentioned within this SLA.
</code></pre></div></div>

<ol>
  <li>Service Unavailability Credits</li>
</ol>

<p>On a per-Service basis, for each month in which the availability is below the target availability of section 5 herein above, Protecturo will reduce the amounts due and payable to it relating to such Service for such month by 5%. In addition, for every 1% loss of availability below target availability of section 5 during the same calendar month, Protecturo will further reduce the amounts due and payable to it relating to such Service for such month by another 2.5%.</p>

<p>Because of the architecture that Protecturo has created to provide the Service, users within an organization may be spread across separate and distinct servers. In the case where one server suffers downtime exceeding the Service level warranty, your organization will be compensated only for the users with accounts on the non-complying server, on a pro-rated basis. Rarely, a Service may be functioning in some areas and not functioning in others. Any of these diminished functioning are not considered downtime and are excluded from availability calculations.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Claim Procedure</li>
</ol>

<p>All requests must be made within seven days following the end of the month in question. Reclamations must include the starting time of the unavailability, the time when services came back to normal and at least three “traceroute” commands taken during the unavailability. Any incomplete reclamation form will be discarded. The request will be processed within ten to fifteen days following its reception.
Article 3 – Specific Terms and Conditions for Exchange Hosting Service</p>
<ol>
  <li>Services Description</li>
</ol>

<p>If selected, Protecturo will make available application services for email, calendaring and task management created using Microsoft Exchange ® server software (“Exchange Hosting Service”). These functions are not Charon Email provided services and while we will provide best effort support, issues with calendaring and task management will be covered by Microsoft. Our intervention will be limited to configuration help, and ensuring that the servers are healthy and functioning.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Disaster Recovery</li>
</ol>

<p>Protecturo schedules daily backups to the shared backup devices. Backups are monitored and checked for errors, and regularly scheduled tests of the restoration procedures are performed. Backup copy retention time is seven days. On a weekly basis, backups are sent off-site. Protecturo does not warrant, however, that a valid backup is available for every day of this seven day period, as applicable. If a disruption of the Service occurs, Protecturo will assign its highest priority and will make its best commercial efforts to ensure the timely restoration of the Service. Depending on the type of disruption that has occurred, Protecturo may elect to first restore the Service without the data. Any data not immediately accessible after a disruption in the Service will be restored from the most recent backup and made accessible with Protecturo’s highest priority. In order to ensure the readiness of Protecturo’s operators to complete the offline restoration process, Protecturo runs frequent drills to test restoration performance. Protecturo is not liable for data loss resulting from the failure or loss of backup media.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Mail Server Availability</li>
</ol>

<p>Subject to the, Protecturo undertakes to maintain 99.9% Mail server uptime. Mail server uptime is defined as the ability to retrieve the SMTP and POP headers from the mail server, calculated on a monthly basis. Protecturo will not monitor availability of individual mail accounts or mailboxes but only monitors the server availability as a whole.</p>

<p>The ouProtecturooing email protocol used on the mail server (SMTP) is a “store-and- forward” type of protocol that does not warrant immediate delivery of email messages. If the mail server’s first email delivery attempt fails, it will re-attempt delivery according to a predefined schedule. If the message fails to be sent for 24 to 72 hours, the messages will be returned to the sender.
Protecturo calculates uptime as a percentage of the time in a month (30 days X 24 hours X 60 minutes) during which the system is available, excluding, but not limited to, the conditions above and all scheduled and urgent maintenances. Any loss of Service availability lasting less than five minutes will not be included in the calculation of Service availability.</p>

<p>Protecturo calculates Service availability based on both monitoring system and incident report from engineering team.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Restoration</li>
</ol>

<p>Protecturo recognizes that from time to time, your users or administrators may mistakenly delete, in whole or in part, items in your database, mailbox or public folders, as applicable. As this is not a system fault and restoration may require partial implementation of our disaster recovery procedures, we reserve the right to charge you, and you agree to pay for, restoration fees of $150 per hour (with a minimum fee of $100), plus taxes. We do not warrant the integrity of the Web content or mailbox content, as applicable, of each individual backup.</p>

<p>Items within a mailbox that have been accidentally deleted can usually be restored directly from the Deleted Item Folder by the end user, even after the Deleted Item folder has been emptied. (Instructions for this procedure are contained within the Outlook ® Help system.) Note, however, that Protecturo retains these deleted items online for no more than seven (7) days. If a public folder or mailbox cannot be recovered from the online Deleted Items storage, Protecturo must restore the items from the backup tapes employed in its disaster recovery systems. Protecturo will restore these items within 96 hours of an approved request from your designated administrator acknowledging the fees.</p>

<p>Please note that email storage may be subject to retention policies applied at the user and organizational level. Those policies are not designed nor enforced by us. If a retention policy is used, and emails are deleted on such a policy’s schedule, they will NOT be retrievable. In addition you are reminded that only unencrypted email can be categorically recovered. We do not warrant in any way the legibility of email that is encrypted, due to loss of a key. Encrypted emails due to loss of a key cannot be retrieved by any means, and you will be made aware of this before any paid recovery attempt is made.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Maintenance</p>

    <p>Planned maintenance:
 Planned maintenances are typically scheduled between 1am and 3am EST, and will typically fall on a weekend. Two-day prior notice shall be given by Protecturo.
 Hot Fixes:
 Installation of urgent “hot fixes” is scheduled as quickly as possible after testing, and a notification is sent to you. The two-day notification mentioned above is waived for urgent hotfixes. Protecturo also reserves additional two (2) two-hour maintenance windows on Wednesdays and Saturdays from 11:00 PM to 1:00 AM (EST), during which the servers may be offline for urgent fixes.
 Mailboxes Movement:
 Protecturo may move mailboxes within the Exchange Hosting Service, among the different Protecturo servers, at its discretion. Protecturo does not warrant that it will send a notification prior to these moves, and they should not affect users whose software is installed and configured correctly. Incorrect configuration of the user’s software, which may result in the inability to connect to the Service, is not considered downtime and is excluded from the calculation of system availability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mail Delivery Terms and Conditions</p>

    <p>Email Delivery Restrictions:
 In order to prevent bandwidth issues for our clients, Protecturo limits attachments to 30 MB. Consistent sending of files of this size may result in action against your account, if it proves to adversely affect the performance of our servers, or negatively impact our other clients. We reserve the right to impose restrictions upon individual users, as required.
 Mail Delivery Time:
 Individual email messages including attachments of less than 20 Mb that are received inbound from the Internet gateways, or those sent from one mailbox on the Exchange Hosting Service to a second mailbox on the Service, generally will be delivered in sixty seconds or less.
 Email messages including attachments of less than 20 Mb outbound to Internet gateways generally will be sent from the Exchange Hosting Service within sixty seconds; delays at the gateways due to Internet issues are not covered by this SLA.
 Exceptions:
 Protecturo gives no guarantee regarding the timing of delivery or receipt of mail being processed on the Internet. Delivery times covered by this SLA are only for mail sent between servers, mailboxes, and/or gateways on the Exchange Hosting Service. Additionally, Protecturo’s spam control functionality performs additional analysis and processing of inbound emails, so the delivery times specified above do not apply for delays due to same.</p>

  </li>
</ol>

<p>Subject to subsection 3.6, Protecturo undertakes to maintain 99.9 average uptime availability of the Exchange Hosting Service’s mailboxes and/or public folders and timely delivery 99.9 % of email messages in accordance with subsection 4 above.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>**Exclusion:
**Any circumstance beyond Protecturo reasonable control, including but not limited to the following conditions are excluded from the calculation of availability and timely delivery:
problem located on the customer’s side, including network/Internet issue;
problem with 3rd party application;
loss of Service availability due to Network Attack such as denials of service, SYN or similar attacks,
issue caused by DNS resolution and/or domain name or certificate expiration;
software “bugs” or problems within used products creating service interruptions, hardware bug or failure beyond high-availability system;
problem located outside our control within the Datacenter exploited by Protecturo , such as Internet and power availability or any other situation mentioned within this SLA.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Protecturo calculates uptime as a percentage of the time in a month (30 days X 24 hours X 60 minutes) during which the system is available, excluding, but not limited to, the conditions above and all scheduled and urgent maintenances. Any loss of Service availability lasting less than five minutes will not be included in the calculation of Service availability. Protecturo calculates Service availability based on both its monitoring system and incident reports from its engineering team. On a per-Service basis, for each month in which the availability is below an average of 99.9% as calculated above, Protecturo will reduce the amounts due and payable to it relating to such Service for such month by 5%. In addition, for every 1% loss of availability below the 99.9% targeted average availability</p>
<ol>
  <li>Service Unavailability Credits</li>
</ol>

<p>If Protecturo fails to provide Exchange Hosting Service’s availability in accordance with section hereinabove for an aggregate total of 2 hours or more in any given month, Protecturo will reduce the amounts due and payable to it relating to the Exchange Hosting Service for such month by 5% for each mailbox affected. For every additional 2 hours of delay of email service during the same calendar month, Protecturo will further reduce the amounts due and payable to it relating to the Exchange Hosting Service by another 5% of the original price charged for such month. The maximum credit per month for message delays shall be 15%.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Claim Procedure</li>

</ol>

<p>Protecturo provides inbound anti-virus scanning as part of the Exchange Hosting Service, and will make its best commercial efforts to protect against SMTP borne viruses and other computer software threats. While Protecturo’s anti-virus protection is state of the art, due to the rapidly evolving nature of viruses, Trojan Horses, and other email-borne security issues, Protecturo can make no warranties against these types of threats or the effectiveness of its anti-virus solution.</p>
<ol>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Your Hermes OS ID: Your Hermes OS username is how you allow others to contact you via Hermes OS. It does not have to be your real name or provide any reference to your identity.
Your Password: We require you to have a password to use the Hermes OS Apps, but we never store your password on our servers and do not store it by default in any form on your device. For your own security, we recommend that you use a long, unique password consisting of a mix of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Optional User-Provided Information: Within the Hermes OS Apps, we provide a few optional features for your convenience. None ask for your personal information, but may allow you to inadvertently provide it. If you want to keep your use of Hermes OS as anonymous as possible, please read these sections carefully in order to understand how we associate information you provide with your Hermes OS Account.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Email Headers and Optional Encryption: Our Charon Email app (part of Hermes OS) provides the option to encrypt any email sent from your mailbox. However, it is only an option. Simply having the Charon Email app does not protect your information or your identity. In addition, we cannot protect your anonymity if you place your name as part of the email header
Forced Encryption in Chat: Charon Secure Messenger allows users to communicate with other users on XMPP based clients in addition to our secured OTR protocol. Such communications are not secured by OTR, as the protection is reliant on two parties having the software. You must actively share your username with any potential contact; however, if you also share your name with a potential contact, prior to establishing a secure OTR connection, we cannot provide any assurances of protection.
Encrypting Files and Images: The Hermes OS Apps will allow you to share PDFs and image files. The Hermes OS Apps will make encrypted copies of these files for sending as Hermes OS messages. Charon Email will diProtecturouise not only the file but also its type by labelling it attachment.pgp. Remember though, that encryption is not automatic. If you elect to send unencrypted emails, attachments will NOT be protected either. By the same token, sending files to an unsecured XMPP contact who does not have OTR protection will also not be protected.
Auto-Login: By default, the Hermes OS Apps will automatically log out of your account after a set period of inactivity, and in order to use the Hermes OS Apps again, you will have to re-enter your password. If you enable Auto-Login, you will be able to use the Hermes OS Apps after a period of inactivity without having to enter your password each time. While you will still benefit from Hermes OSÊ¼s security (e.g., deletion, encryption, etc.) and may find that your user experience is more seamless, this option is less secure than the default logout and password requirements, and we suggest that users who enable Auto-Login retain other security measures on their devices, like enabling screen locks and PINs through your device settings.
Crash Log: For the purpose of debugging and error correction as well as for system continuity, users might choose to send crash logs to Hermes OS when prompted by the app. The logs do not contain any user personal information and they pertain only to the Hermes OS Apps. The process is voluntary and users can choose not to send their crash logs to us at any time. Participating in errors/crash reporting will help Hermes OS to become a better app.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Automatically Collected Information: Hermes OS collects two types of information automatically during your setup and use of the Hermes OS Apps: Device Information and Aggregate Usage Data.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Device Information: The Hermes OS Apps will collect a hashed representation of both your mobile device type and your mobile device’s hardware ID during registration, in order to connect that information with your account and to tie your account to your device.
Aggregate Usage Data: During the operation of our services, we also collect aggregate, anonymous information about basic usage statistics, such as the number of messages sent by all Hermes OS users daily, what types of messages our users tend to send (e.g., voice messages more often than text), and so forth. We never attempt to (and cannot) identify users associated with any of this information.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What Information Does Hermes OS Share with Third Parties?</p>

<p>We do not share any user information we have with third parties, with the exception of the third-party service with whom we share your phone number for the sole purpose of sending you an SMS confirmation if you choose to associate your phone number with your Hermes OS ID. Please note that the provision of a phone number is completely at the user’s discretion.</p>

<p><em>Law Enforcement:</em></p>

<p>Please see our Law Enforcement Guidelines but here is a brief summary.</p>

<p>We will always notify you of any third party requests for your information unless legally unable to do so. We require a warrant before handing over the contents of your communication, however, because of the nature of our technology, the contents of your communication will be undecipherable if obtained.
We Retain as Little Data as Possible, for the Least Time Possible</p>

<p>Data Retention on Hermes OSs Servers: Our nodes store the encrypted messages that you send and receive only long enough to ensure their reliable delivery. Undelivered messages are deleted after a reasonable period of time. We retain non- message data (i.e. Types of messages, usernames) for as long as you use the Hermes OS Services and for an indefinite time thereafter.</p>

<p>Data Retention on Your Device: All messages are stored encrypted on end users’ mobile devices. You choose your own retention policy for your messages by choosing how long a message is saved before it is deleted. Deleted messages cannot be recovered.
We Are Serious About Security</p>

<p>We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our Services. No sensitive information is in the clear: we make reasonable efforts (as described in the Privacy Policy) to ensure that everything we store is not retrievable by us or anyone else.</p>

<p>However, as security experts, we know that no security system can prevent all potential security breaches. Therefore we have limited the potential implications of such a breach by designing our system so that in the event of a breach, we would have the least possible information about you.
We Can Change This Privacy Policy</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time, for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here along with information about what has changed and an archive of past policies. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.

LAW ENFORCEMENT GUIDE LINE
What is Hermes OS?</p>

<p>Hermes OS is a bundle of applications created by  that provides encryption of communication  channels and local encrypted file management system</p>

<p>Charon Email: Our email application enhances regular email functionality with an intuitive and easy to use iteration of the open source technology of PGP encryption. Any email encrypted by PGP is irretrievable by us or any other party. The body of the email is secure and so is any attachment. Our solution even diProtecturouises the file type of any attachment, by labelling all as ‘attachment.pgp’.</p>

<p>Charon Secure Messenger: Charon Secure Messenger offers secure communication over XMPP based chat servers. Our secure communication servers use the OTR protocol to ensure that conversations are entirely private, eliminating even the meta-data that is typical of many email encryption solutions. Unlike other Charon Secure Messenger  programs, no data is stored on our servers, not even messages waiting to be delivered. Rather than storing chat messages on the server until the recipient is online, the messages are held on the device until the recipient is available.
Private Information Requires a Subpoena or Court Order</p>

<p>Non-public information about  Technologies user accounts will not be released to law enforcement except in response to appropriate legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or other valid legal process.
Contents of Communications Are Not Available</p>

<p>Requests for the contents of communications require a valid search warrant from an agency with proper jurisdiction over  Technologies. However, our response to such a request will reflect that either the content is not available or that, in very limited instances where a message has not yet been retrieved by the recipient, the content will be limited to scrambled data which is indecipherable.
Will  Notify Users of Requests for Account Information?</p>

<p>We will notify users of requests for their account information prior to disclosure including providing user with a copy of the request, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so.
What Information Can  Supply You With?</p>

<p>Technologies has the following information about User Accounts:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Date an account was created
Name provided by purchaser and method of billing used (if purchased on behalf of an organization, only the purchaser will have a name associated)
username selected
Type of device on which such account was installed
Date of last use
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What Must Be Included in Account Information Requests?</p>

<p>When requesting user account information, you must include ALL of the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>User name (Charon username) for account being investigated
A valid official email address
Law enforcement letterhead
Description of account information being sought
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Service of Process</p>

<p>We do not accept legal process via email unless otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p>However law enforcement authorities may notify us of upcoming mail delivery and what to look for to expedite matters.
Production of Records and Authentication</p>

<p>We provide responsive records in electronic format unless otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction and believe that any records produced in response to a valid law enforcement request are self-authenticating. If you require a declaration, please explicitly note that in your request.
