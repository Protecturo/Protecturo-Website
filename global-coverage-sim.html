<h1 id="sim-cards-in-every-form-factor">SIM cards in every form factor</h1>

<p>GreenSIM M2M are available in all SIM card form factors: 2FF (mini), 3FF (micro), 4FF (nano), and MFF2 (eSIM). You can select commercial grade, industrial grade, or embedded SIMs. Each form factor is compatible with eUICC and Multi-IMSI technology. Whatever your use case, we’ll get you connected.</p>

<p>Commercial grade IoT SIMs are our most affordable option for mass production. These are available in all form factors. You can select a dual-cut combination offering 2FF Mini and 3FF Micro form factors, or a triple-cut combination model, offering 2FF Mini, 3FF Micro and 4FF Nano form factors.Commercial grade IoT SIMs are our most affordable option for mass production. These are available in all form factors. You can select a dual-cut combination offering 2FF Mini and 3FF Micro form factors, or a triple-cut combination model, offering 2FF Mini, 3FF Micro and 4FF Nano form factors.</p>

<p>Industrial grade SIM cards are more durable and resilient than standard SIMs, making them ideal for applications like smart manufacturing, smart transportation, and healthcare IoT. You can select from three different form factors: 2FF Mini and 3FF Nano plugin modules, and MFF2 soldered modules.</p>

<p>Embedded SIMs (eSIMs) get soldered directly onto the circuit board, giving them extra protection from environmental factors and potential tampering.</p>

<h2 id="global-sim">Global SIM</h2>

<p>Our carrier-agnostic IoT SIMs have access to multiple networks wherever you deploy. As you expand into new countries, you’ll never need to negotiate or integrate with new providers. Using Multi-IMSI technology, our SIMs store up to five subscriber identities and switch profiles as needed. With eUICCs, you can provision SIMs with new profiles Over-the-Air (OTA).</p>

<h2 id="automatic-network-selection">Automatic network selection</h2>

<p>Whether you optimize for signal strength or data rates, your devices will select the best available network by default. If the preferred cellular network doesn’t have service, your device automatically finds one that does.</p>

<h2 id="advanced-iot-security">Advanced IoT security</h2>

<p>Between our intuitive IoT monitoring dashboard and our specialized IoT SIM cards, your devices and applications benefit from crucial IoT security features like network-based firewalls, SMS firewalls, IMEI locks, VPNs, connectivity profiles, and more.</p>

<h2 id="pricing-made-for-iot">Pricing made for IoT</h2>

<p>Telegreen has no minimum contract duration, and you can upgrade, downgrade, or pause subscriptions at any time. Our pricing is transparent, and you only pay for active SIMs. Choose a pay-as-you-go model or our data-pooling option to avoid unexpected costs and ensure you only pay for data your devices use. Select the size of your deployment, choose your desired coverage, and pick a pricing model.</p>

<h2 id="cloud-based-infrastructure">Cloud-based infrastructure</h2>

<p>We globally distribute our mobile network infrastructure through public clouds. As you develop your IoT solution, we can provide simple, automated intra-cloud integrations using standard web services. Thanks to our distributed infrastructure, your transmissions use regional Internet breakouts, speeding up communications by routing your data through the closest servers.</p>
