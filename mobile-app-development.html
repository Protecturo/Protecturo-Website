<p>Mobile has already become prevalent over the desktop. In current market’s conditions, a mobile application is a must for businesses and startups.</p>

<p>When a company is faced with the issue of mobile app development, at Protecturo we offer our customers a native mobile development, as it allows delivering the best customer service and gives wider options for post-MVP development.</p>

<h1 id="we-build-native-apps">We build native apps</h1>

<p>So what are the key advantages of the native mobile application development?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Higher performance</li>
</ul>

<p>As native app development service provides the product specifically for a certain operation system, it makes the performance of application faster and smarter. This factor is crucial for applications with a huge amount of data.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Better UX</li>
</ul>

<p>Both iOS and Android operating systems have their individual specifications and feature that user got used to. Hybrid app development can’t provide good UX/UI design for every operating system at the same time. That means that without native application for every group of users, you may lose one of them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Easier access to built-in capabilities of the smartphone.</li>
</ul>

<p>The native mobile application gives the better access for build-in functionalities of smartphones such as camera, GPS, accelerometer, microphone, calendar, etc. While having a cross-platform application provides only limited access to all these services. Can you imagine the application that can impress user without all those features?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Better Security</li>
</ul>

<p>Security of mobile application allows distinguishing qualitative application from the unsafe one. To guarantee safekeeping of application’s data mobile device requires better performance of the system.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Better access to the audience</li>
</ul>

<p>App markets give better support to the applications that use native app development. Such applications can be more quickly discovered by users and get more marketing options and promotional support from the platform.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eliminating need for the permanent internet connection</li>
</ul>

<p>When it comes to cross-platform applications, sustainable internet connection is always required. At the same time, the native mobile app can work without the web.</p>
